Minimal viable website for the consultations commons

This project aims to show what's possible for a MVP for the Consultations Commons, Consultations related toolkits and iterating on Consulting Canadians.

This project is a prototype, all content is working and issues can be submitted by any interested parties. Looking forward to collaborating.
